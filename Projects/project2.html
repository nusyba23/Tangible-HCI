            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The "Flex Sensor MIDI Piano" is an interactive musical instrument built using an Arduino and a flex sensor. 
                It converts the bending of the flex sensor into MIDI messages that are transmitted via USB, allowing the performer to play 
                piano notes by bending their finger. For this project, I integrated the online virtual MIDI piano from <a href="https://muted.io/piano/" target="_blank">Muted.io Piano</a> to trigger the notes. As the sensor bends, different notes are played, with pitch changes ranging from thicker to thinner.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was inspired by a friend who wanted to cover a song for YouTube, and I thought it would be an interesting project to integrate sensor-based control with an online virtual piano.
            </p>
            <h3>Materials Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arduino ATMEGA32U4 (Leonardo)</li>
                <li>1 Flex Sensor</li>
                <li>10kΩ Resistor</li>
                <li>USB Cable</li>
                <li>A Glove (for integration)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Functionality:</h3>
            <p>
                The flex sensor is mounted on a glove, and bending the finger triggers MIDI notes on the virtual piano at <a href="https://muted.io/piano/" target="_blank">Muted.io Piano</a>.
                The pitch changes based on how much the sensor is bent, making it an intuitive and physical way to play digital instruments.

        <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
        <p>
            Below is the Arduino code used in this project. The flex sensor values are read and mapped to MIDI notes (C4 to C5 range). The Arduino sends these MIDI
            messages directly via USB, and they are routed to the virtual piano at <a href="https://muted.io/piano/" target="_blank">Muted.io Piano</a>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
// Include the MIDIUSB library
#include "MIDIUSB.h"  

int flexPin = A1;  // Pin where the flex sensor is connected
int prevNote = -1;  // To track the previous note to avoid repetition

void setup() {
  // No need for Serial.begin() as we are using direct USB MIDI
}

void loop() {
  int flexValue = analogRead(flexPin);  // Read the flex sensor value
  
  // Map flex sensor value to MIDI note numbers (adjust these ranges if necessary)
  int pitch = map(flexValue, 300, 600, 60, 72);  // C4 to C5 (MIDI note range)

  // Only send a new note if the pitch has changed to avoid repeated notes
  if (pitch != prevNote) {
    // Send the Note On message
    midiEventPacket_t noteOn = {0x09, 0x90, pitch, 127};  // 0x90 = Note On, 127 = max velocity
    MidiUSB.sendMIDI(noteOn);
    MidiUSB.flush();  // Send the data
    
    delay(500);  // Sustain the note for 500 ms

    // Send the Note Off message
    midiEventPacket_t noteOff = {0x08, 0x80, pitch, 0};  // 0x80 = Note Off
    MidiUSB.sendMIDI(noteOff);
    MidiUSB.flush();  // Send the data
    
    prevNote = pitch;  // Store the current note
  }

  delay(100);  // Small delay before next reading
}
        </code></pre>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The flex sensor is mounted on the index finger of a glove. As the performer bends their finger, the sensor's resistance changes, and this change is read by the 
            Arduino as a voltage change. The Arduino then maps the bending motion to different MIDI notes (ranging from C4 to C5). These notes are sent via USB to 
            the virtual piano at <a href="https://muted.io/piano/" target="_blank">Muted.io Piano</a>, where the notes are played in real time.
        </p>
        <h3>Usage:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put on the glove and connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.</li>
            <li>Open the virtual piano at <a href="https://muted.io/piano/" target="_blank">Muted.io Piano</a>.</li>
            <li>As you bend your finger, you’ll hear different piano notes being played!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Creative Possibilities:</h3>
        <p>
            The project can be expanded by adding more sensors to control other aspects of the sound, such as volume or effects. Additional buttons can also be incorporated to switch 
            between instruments or octaves, allowing the glove to become a fully-fledged MIDI controller for live performances or studio recording.
