# Tangible Human-Computer Interaction - Arduino Projects

Welcome to the **Tangible Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course project repository! This website showcases a series of Arduino-based projects designed to explore the world of tangible interfaces, where digital data is connected to physical representations through interactive, hands-on projects. Each project demonstrates core concepts in physical computing, providing a unique approach to human-computer interaction.

## About the Course
This repository was developed as part of the Tangible Human-Computer Interaction course, where students learn to create interactive physical interfaces using Arduino. Through these projects, we explore how tangible elements can be used to provide feedback, control digital interfaces, and represent data in a physical, engaging way.

## Projects Overview
This repository features three key Arduino projects, each with unique interactive elements and use cases. Each project is fully documented with code, schematics, and explanations to help you understand and recreate the work.

### Project 1: LED Blink
- **Description**: This beginner-level project demonstrates basic control of an LED using Arduino. A button is integrated to toggle the LED on and off, providing an introduction to input/output controls and circuit basics.

### Project 2: Flex Sensor MIDI Piano
- **Description**: The Flex Sensor MIDI Piano allows users to control musical notes by bending a flex sensor. This project combines Arduino with MIDI communication to translate physical movements into sound, making it an interactive musical instrument.

### Project 3: Touch-Sensitive Mood Indicator
- **Description**: This project uses a touch-sensitive flex sensor to represent different moods. Based on the sensor's bend level, a servo motor controls the opening and closing of flower petals, visually indicating calm, neutral, and stressed states. Inspired by mood-indicating plush toys, this project adds a tangible element to self-reflection and mood tracking.
